\section{Installation setup}
For installing and running the project, the section 7.1 of the implementation document has been followed. 
A comment on this could be that the instructions presented are not much detailed and consists of only three steps. 
Furthermore, one may notice that having performed this initial release with docker, forces a user having a windows non-pro/ultimate version to
install a virtual machine with an operative system that supports docker. However, this is considered to be reasonable, but some comments
on this not-so-exceptional case would have been welcome. \\
However, the docker environment allows to setup the whole system really fast, and without any problem encountered.
