\section{Acceptance tests}
The approach to acceptance testing, for both data for help and automated SOS, has been
conducted in the following way. 
First of all, it has been decided to test all the possible use cases that are described in the
second version of the requirements and analysis document (of course, only the scenarios that
regards the implemented requirements and goals, mentioned in the implementation and document testing, have been considered). \\
The exceptions of the various use cases have been considered too, since the system should
behave properly, also, in these conditions. \\
Secondly, the website has been tested manually, by exploring the UI and its possibilities. \\

The tests that regards the user cases have been performed with JMeter. The source code is present in the delivery folder. 
Before starting the testing phase it is necessary to know the structure of the JSON files that are sent to the server. To do this we used
one of the JMeter feature: HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder which can be used to record all the requests a web
application is making to the server. As the name suggests, it will capture only the HTTP(s) requests. To make it work, it is necessary to set a Web Proxy on the browser to localhost:port (e.g. 8888 the standard port of the Test Script Recorder) and start the recording. After this it is possible to navigate on the browser and every request will be recorded and added on the "Recorder Controller" (look RecordingTemplate.jmx file)

The cases are presented in the next two subsections, each of them, first exposes the
tests performed on the use cases divided by goal. After that, the manual tests on the UI are presented. \\
Finally, at the end of this chapter, it is possible to find some brief conclusions.
