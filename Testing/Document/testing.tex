\section{Acceptance tests}
The approach to acceptance testing, for both data for help and automated SOS, has been
conducted in the following way. 
First of all, it has been decided to test all the possible use cases that are described in the
second version of the requirements and analysis document (of course, only the scenarios that
regards the implemented requirements and goals, mentioned in the implementation and document testing, have been considered). \\
The exceptions of the various use cases have been considered too, since the system should
behave properly, also, in these conditions. \\
Secondly, due to the fact that an user may behave in non-predicted way, other cases, for some
requirements have been considered. \\
Tests have been performed with JMeter. The source code is present in the delivery folder.

\par
The cases are presented in the next two subsections, each of which first exposes the
tests performed on the use cases divided by goal. After that, special cases and more strange
behaviours are considered. \\
Finally, at the end of this chapter, it is possible to find some brief conclusions.
