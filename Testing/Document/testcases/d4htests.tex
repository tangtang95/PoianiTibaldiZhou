\subsubsection{G1}
The uses cases that concerns G1 are: UC1, UC2, UC3, UC4, UC5, UC6, UC7 and UC9.  \\

\par 
For what concerns UC1, the successful case has been tested (no exception is present), by using some requirements that involves the
third party registration and the possibility to send individual request. In particular, after having created a new third party customer,
and a new user; a request from that customer to the user is made. The user retrieves the list of pending requests (that contains only that
element) and approves and rejects it.

UC5

\par 
UC6 involves the sign up of user and individual requests. The successful case has been tested and also the cases in which SSN and email
are already present in the system. \\
The result is the following: userId and accessToken returned by the server are correct. In particular, they have been used to check
if the user was registered by performing an http request to retrieve the user's information.  \\
The exception about checking if fields are empty or not has been skipped since this is something that is implemented correctly in the front
end.

\par 
UC7 consists in logging users and third parties into the system. The normal event flow and the cases of wrong credential has been tested.
The same check adopted in UC6 has been used here. \\ 
The exception that involves missing password or email, has been skipped since this is something that is implemented correctly in the front 
end.
