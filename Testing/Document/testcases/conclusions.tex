\subsection{Conclusion}
The prototype has been developed until a good point, but it still contains some bugs. In particular, many of them regards the user interface
and the website. \\
For what concerns the single goals, we can say the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
It is possible to state that G1 has been reached. However there are some problems with the notification of third party when individual
requests are approved or rejected.

\item
A same reasoning can be applied also to G2. Indeed, UC32 and UC33 present problems with the notifications

\item
G3 has not been fully reached. To be precise, there is the problem with the constraint on 1000 individuals while accessing bulk data

\item 
G4 is achieved correctly

\item 
For what concerns G5, it has been possible to test graphically only the fact that, after having registered a user older than 60 years old, 
and when 10 seconds are elapsed, a request arrives from ASOS, that is some kind of special third party customer. \\
As mentioned in the section regarding the test of G5, the other functionalities could not be tested.\\

\par
In conclusion, the prototype is not ready to be deployed on the market due to previous problems.

\end{itemize}
