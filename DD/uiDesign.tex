\section{User interface design}
Since the application is thought as a set of  microservices, the user interface may be designed according to this style. 
For this reason, composition UI generated by microservices, will be adopted. 
With a composition approach, frontend application is divided into modules, one for each service, and each module is developed independently by a separate member of a team. 
Each member takes the whole responsibility for their product. 
So he develops not only backend logic but also provides an endpoint which serves fragment with their piece of frontend. 
Then, the UI is assembled using some low level server-side, like a AppGateway. 
The mock-ups for this application were presented in the RASD Document in section 3.1.1.
