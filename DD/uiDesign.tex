\section{User interface design}
Since the application is thought as a set of  microservices, the user interface may be designed according to this style. 
For this reason, composition UI generated by microservices, will be adopted. 
With a composition approach, frontend application is divided into modules, one for each service, and each module is developed independently.
Then, the UI is assembled using some low level server-side, like an API Gateway. The mock-ups for this application were presented in the RASD Document in section 3.1.1.
