\section{User interface design}
Since the application is thought as a microservices, also the user interface should follow the same style. For this it uses a composition UI generate by microservices. In Composition approach, frontend application is divided into modules, one for each service, and each module is developed independently by separate member of team. Each member takes whole responsibility for their product. So he develops not only backend logic but also provides an endpoint which serves fragment with their piece of frontend. Then, the UI is assembled using some low level server-side, like a AppGateway. The mock-ups for this application were presented in the RASD Document in section 3.1.1.
