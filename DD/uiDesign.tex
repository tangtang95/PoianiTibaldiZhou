\section{User interface design}
Since the application is thought as a set of  microservices, the user interface may be designed according to
this style. 
For this reason, composition UI generated by microservices, will be adopted. 
With a composition approach, frontend application is divided into modules, one for each service.  \\
The mock-ups for the application are available in the RASD, section 3.1.1.
