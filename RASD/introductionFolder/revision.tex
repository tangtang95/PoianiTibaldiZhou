\subsection{Revision history}
\begin{itemize}
\item v1.0: The document regards analysis of requirements before starting other processes such as design or implementation.
\item v1.1: The document has undergone some changes after analyzing the design document:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item the requirement R45 has been added, otherwise third party could not manage the race.
	\item the domain assumption D6 has been changed slightly.
	\item a new background application to be designed has been added in the product perspective and then, also, a communication interface for this has been added.
	\item new use case about view list of managed race has been added to the use case diagram 
	\item name changing in the state of the request state diagram
	\item changing every word about "as soon as" in "after", because "as soon as" was a requirement too strict (ambiguity issue)
	\item the domain assumption D5 has been changed slightly
	\item the requirement R16 has been changed slightly
	\item the domain assumption D7 has been deleted because it was not really a domain assumption
	\item two abbreviations have been added
	\item in the product functions a section about future data in data requests from third party customers is moved in subscriptions to new data reformulated with a new phrase.
	\item the goal G9 has been extended and the same modification is propagated to the requirements
	\item the requirement R46 has been added regarding the extension of G9
	\item change text caption under figure 15 since android is too specific at this abstraction level
	\item the requirement R6 has been deleted because it is not necessary
	\item the reliability has been slightly changed due to a unspecific non-functional requirement
	\item the availability has been explained better
	\item the portability has been changed due to incoherence with the design document
	\end{itemize}
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
\item v.1.2: The implementation is partially finished and there are some changes due to this:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the domain assumption D8 in the functional requirements section was different from the D8 of domain assumption section, therefore, the two has been merged into the D8 of the functional requirements one.
\end{itemize}
=======
\item v1.2: The document has been reviewed after having implementing some of the
core functions: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item G9 has been better specified 
	\item R29 has been modified in order to reach the new G9
	\item R5 has been removed since it is now considered to be wrong
	\item the calls service in the software interfaces has been modified since 
	it was imprecise
	\end{itemize}		
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
