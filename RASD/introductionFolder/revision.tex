\begin{itemize}
\item v1.0: The document regards analysis of requirements before starting other processes such as design or implementation.
\item v1.1: The document has undergone some changes after analyzing the design document:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item the requirement R45 has been added, otherwise third party could not manage the race.
	\item the domain assumption D6 has been changed slightly.
	\item a new background application to be designed has been added in the product perspective and then, also, a communication interface for this has been added.
	\item new use case about view list of managed race has been added to the use case diagram 
	\item name changing in the state of the request state diagram
	\item changing every word about "as soon as" in "after", because "as soon as" was a requirement too strict (ambiguity issue)
	\item the domain assumption D5 has been changed slightly
	\item the requirement R16 has been changed slightly
	\item the domain assumption D7 has been deleted because it was not really a domain assumption
	\item two abbreviations have been added
