\subsection{Purpose}

The goals of the project, regarding the subscribed users, are the followings:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[{[G1]}] Allow a subscribed user to share his location and health status to third parties of his choice
\item[{[G2]}]Once the health parameters of a subscribed user have been observed 
below the threshold, an ambulance is sent to the user location. (requires further specifications and assumptions: e.g. who owns the ambulances?)
\item[{[G3]}] The time experienced between the moment in which the health parameters of a subscribed user are observed below the threshold and the time in which the ambulance is sent to the user location is equal or less than 5 seconds. 
\item[{[G4]}] Allow a subscribed user to enroll in a run, as athlete
\item[{[G5]}] Allow spectators too see on a map the positions of all athletes taking part in a run
\item[{[G6]}] Allow an organizer to set up a run, by defining its path
\end{enumerate}

The goals of the project, regarding the third part customers, are the followings:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[{[G7]}] Allow a third party to access the data on a certain individual, only if he accepts. This is satisfied as soon as the request is approved
\item[{[G8]}] Allow a third party to access statistical and anonymized data on group of individual greater than 1000. This is satisfied as soon as the request is approved
\item[{[G9]}] Allow a third party to subscribe to non-existing data. They will have access to them, as soon as the data is generated. 
\end{enumerate}
