\subsection{Design constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}


\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The hardware limitations of the application are strict for the user. Infact, he needs two devices, and the second one is not so wide-spread:
\begin{itemize}
\item A smartphone, for being connected to the TrackMe system. This allow him to accept or refuse requests from third party customer, enroll in available runs and spectate races. The smarthphone required, needs an Internet connection, used for communicating with the system. \\ 
Furthermore, it needs GPS and NFC sensors.  
\item A device provided of at least a NFC sensor: this will collect health status of the user and will communicate with the smarthphone. The data detection and the communication must be performed in a fast way (see performance requirements)
\end{itemize}

For what concerns the hardware limitations of the third party customers, they are not strict at all. They only needs a smartphone that can access to the Internet in order to send requests and access information.
