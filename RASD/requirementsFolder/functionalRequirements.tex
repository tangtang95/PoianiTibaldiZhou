\subsection{Functional requirements}
\par
The functional requirements will be listed with different way:
\begin{itemize}
\item Some will be called core requirements, which satisfy more or less every goals in a simple way (e.g. registration, log-in, ...)
\item Other requirements are listed together with the goal which they satisfy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Core requirements}
\par
The following requirements are, principally, about registration:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{[R1]}] Allow a person to register into the system as a user by providing an username, a passowrd, credentials and a consensus on an agreement
\item[{[R2]}] Allow a person or company to register into the system as a third party by providing an e-mail, a password, credentials and a consensus on an agreement
\item[{[R3]}] A person cannot register as a user by inserting a username already used by someone else
\item[{[R4]}] A person or company cannot register as a third party by inserting an e-mail already used by someone else
\item[{[R5]}] A person cannot register as user more than once into the system by using the same credentials
\item[{[R6]}] A person or company cannot register as third party more than once into the system by using the same credentials
\end{itemize}
\par
After the registration, another essential functionality of the system is to log-in:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{[R7]}] Allow a person to log into the system as a user only if he has already registered as such
\item[{[R8]}] Allow a person or company to log into the system as a third party only if he has already registered as such
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goal reaching requirements}
\par
In this section, each requirement is necessary to satisfy specific goals of the system:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{[G1]}] Once the health parameters of a subscribed user have been observed below the threshold, an ambulance is sent to the user location \& [G2] The time experienced between the moment in which the health parameters of a subscribed user are observed below the threshold and the time in which the ambulance is sent to the user location is equal or less than 5 seconds. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[{[R9]}] When a user's health parameters has been observed below the threshold, an SOSCall is requested within 5 seconds
\item[{[R10]}] An SOSCall can be requested only every minute
\item[{[R11]}] An SOSCall is blocked if a previous one has already been accepted within 4 hours 
\item[{[R12]}] An SOSCall are implemented as automated calls by using an external service
\end{itemize}
\item[{[G1]}] 
\end{itemize}
