\subsection{Scenarios}

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
The company Canpari, whose business regards the production of natural and herbal medicines, needs data on the health statuses, during last year, of the inhabitants of Milan. This will allow them to evaluate the project of opening their first shop in the city. \\
Therefore, with their Data4Help account, the marketing office compiles and sends an aggregated request for accessing the needed information. 
Once the demand is received, the system analyzes it: since there are, of course, more than a thousand of user subscribed in Milan, the requests is approved and the access will be eventually granted to Canpari. 

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
The company Tibaldi\&Zhou has set up a shocking outdoor art show that will take place in the following two months in Piazza Duomo.
Therefore, it is interested in having access to data regarding the health statuses of users that visit this location when they are close to the exhibition.
This is necessary in order to monitor the public feedback thanks to the usage of heart rate of possible spectators. \\
In order to accomplish this purpose, they subscribe, using Data4Help, to the mentioned above future data: when the two months will pass by, the system will evaluate the anonymization constraint. Since there will have been, of course, more than 1000 user that pass from Piazza Duomo, the access will be provided to the company. 

\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
Jacob is preparing for a marathon and, while training, he always keeps with him all the equipment necessary to monitor his health.
Unfortunately, yesterday he had an hearth attack while running, but his device was able to detect the health parameters below the threshold and have suddenly called the nearest hospital. \\
Once the call was picked up, the device has communicated autonomously to the emergency room operator the observed health status and the location of the user, in order to request for an ambulance. 
Since, the operator understood the dangerous situation, he has accepted the demand and sent an ambulance to the location.

\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
The company Like wants to organize a public run in Milan and it assigns this task to Mattia, who is the chief of the public relations office. \\
Therefore, Mattia opens the TrackMe's application and fills the form for submitting a new run event. 
More specifically, he defines the name of the run, its path, the date and the time in which the run will start, and a closure date for the subscriptions. 
Furthermore, he also specifies 10 as the minimum number of people that needs to be present.

\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
Tang-Tang and his 9 friends are amateur runners that want to join a run in order to get some fun. 
Therefore, they decide to enroll, before the expiration date, in a run, whose minimum number of athletes is 10, organized by Abibas on the 5th of November. \\
When the expiration date arrives, the system checks the constraints on the number of runners. 
Since this constraint is satisfied, they wait for the day of the event: at this point they race and, at the end of the competition, the leaderboard is available. 

\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
Harry, who use the TrackMe application daily, keeps receiving everyday individual requests from an Indian company and he continues to refuse.\\
Finally, one day, he decides to block requests from that company: he won't see any spam demand anymore and the access is, of course, not granted. 

\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
Zhao, who is very concerned about his health status, pays a private company to analyze all of his health status data. \\ 
In order to accomplish this, he receives an individual request from them and he accepts it: after he does, the company will have eventually access to the needed information.

\subsubsection{Scenario 8}
Giulio is very worried about his old father, Franco, and, therefore, he convinces him to use the TrackMe application: in this way, he can send him a request to access his data, and keep the situation under control. \\
Franco, according to the deal, registers to the service: he provides credentials, a username, its social security number and a password. 
The system checks that an account associated with identification information and social security number does not exist: since this constraint is satisfied, the registration happens without any problem.  

\subsubsection{Scenario 9}
Matteo, who is already a TrackMe user, has recently bought a new phone.
Therefore, since he wants to keep using the application, he needs to perform the login.\\
To reach this goal, he provides his username and password: since he types both of them correctly, the access to the application is performed.
