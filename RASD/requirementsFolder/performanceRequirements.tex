\subsection{Performance requirements}
The system must be able to manage elevate number of users, because one of the scope is to provide access to anonymized data that involves more then 1000 users. Even if at the beginning a range of 50000-100000 users is estimated, the system has to be flexible and support scalability. \\
Furthermore, the AutomatedSOS service is critical for the life of people, therefore, the health status and user location detection have to be performed in a fast way: the time experienced between the observation of health status parameter below the threshold and the dispatch of an emergency call, has to be less or equal than 5 seconds.
